ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

I achieved all the required goals and 3/5 stretch goals. I added delete buttons, dynamic routing, and used UseNavigate aswell.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
The likes on a post and filtered posts.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I put my time into refining the other bits and css and making it all come together.


I pushed myself further than all the previous weeks for this assignment. Wrapping my head around how REACT re-renders everything was hard,
also the level of detail in the SQL queries and joint tables really stumbled me quite alot. I spent a large amount of time debugging, learning
new things, reading the REACT docs, constantly changing my database and googling the errors in my console and using AI to explain Sam's demonstration
etc. But I am happy with the final result, and I look forward to getting better at REACT and the back end!


READ BEFORE USING PLEASE!

The app works this way:

You are taken to a home page, you can use the links or the navbar to go to the movies page or movies for.

On the movies page, you can see the movies already added, and when you click on the individual movie you can view the details about it and the actors as a list (this took so long!!). You can also delete a movie.

The add movie page takes you to a form, you can fill it out, and when you add the actors please use a comma in between, as specified in the input box.

On submit, it should take you back to the movies page (using useNavigate from react-router-dom), and the new movie should be there!
